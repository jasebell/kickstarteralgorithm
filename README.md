### Kickstarter Ranking Algorithm

Based on a blog post which you can read [here](http://dataissexy.wordpress.com/2013/10/10/do-i-pledge-the-kickstarter-algorithm-part-1/).

#### Getting started.

Clone the repository and fire up R. 

At the command line type the following:

`source('kick.r')`

Then use the ranking() method to rank the project (see the blog post for the variables)

`brewbot<-ranking(5,8,7,4,8)`
